<h1>OOP(Object-Oriented Programming)🔗✨</h1>
<p>OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.🎯🪢 Using it in JavaScript is a very good approach because it makes the code clean and reusable. It prevents the code from becoming complex, which makes it easier to understand. When multiple developers are working on the same project, it helps everyone understand the code more easily, as the code becomes readable and easy to follow. In large or complex projects, using OOP is a smart choice. It prevents the code from turning into a tangled mess (like spaghetti code). OOP principles also allow us to keep some data private and show only what's necessary to the user. Additionally, we can inherit properties and methods from one class (parent class) into another and OOP also allows us to use the same method in different ways.🎢</p>
