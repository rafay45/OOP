<h1>OOP(Object-Oriented Programming)🔗✨</h1>
<p>OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.🎯🪢 Using it in JavaScript is a very good approach because it makes the code clean and reusable. It prevents the code from becoming complex, which makes it easier to understand. When multiple developers are working on the same project, it helps everyone understand the code more easily, as the code becomes readable and easy to follow. In large or complex projects, using OOP is a smart choice. It prevents the code from turning into a tangled mess (like spaghetti code). OOP principles also allow us to keep some data private and show only what's necessary to the user. Additionally, we can inherit properties and methods from one class (parent class) into another and OOP also allows us to use the same method in different ways.🎢</p>

<h2>Principles(Pillars)🏛️</h2>
<h5>There are four Principle Of OOP(Object-Oriented Programming), Which are also called Pillars. The Following are </h5>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Abstraction</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Encapsulation</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Inheritance</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Polymorphism</h5>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Abstraction:📱📶</h3>
<p>Abstraction means that we hide the internal code from the user and only show what is necessary for them. The behind-the-scenes logic is only known to the developer — the user doesn’t need to know how things work in the background.

For example, when we make a call using a mobile phone, we just press the call button. We don’t know how the signals are being sent, how the connection is made — all that happens behind the scenes. This is how abstraction works.</p>
