<h1>OOP(Object-Oriented Programming)🔗✨</h1>
<p>🔷 OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.🎯🪢 Using it in JavaScript is a very good approach because it makes the code clean and reusable. It prevents the code from becoming complex, which makes it easier to understand. When multiple developers are working on the same project, it helps everyone understand the code more easily, as the code becomes readable and easy to follow. In large or complex projects, using OOP is a smart choice. It prevents the code from turning into a tangled mess (like spaghetti code). OOP principles also allow us to keep some data private and show only what's necessary to the user. Additionally, we can inherit properties and methods from one class (parent class) into another and OOP also allows us to use the same method in different ways.🎢</p>

<h2>Principles(Pillars)🏛️</h2>
<h5>There are four Principle Of OOP(Object-Oriented Programming), Which are also called Pillars. The Following are:</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Abstraction</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Encapsulation</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Inheritance</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Polymorphism</h5>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>1. Abstraction:📱📶</h3>
<p>🔹Abstraction means that we hide the internal code from the user and only show what is necessary for them. The behind-the-scenes logic is only known to the developer, the user doesn’t need to know how things work in the background.

For example, when we make a call using a mobile phone, we just press the call button. We don’t know how the signals are being sent, how the connection is made all that happens behind the scenes. This is how abstraction works.</p>

<h3>2. Encapsulation:🔐🛅</h3>
<p>🔹Encapsulation means that we can keep certain data private using this principle. For example, if we have a password or any piece of code that we don't want to show to the user, we can make it private. In JavaScript, if we want to keep a password private, we use #password.

The # symbol is required to make something private. Normally, we call it a "hash", but in JavaScript, it is known as a Private Modifier, Private Identifier, Hash Symbol, or Private Marker.

This private code can only be used inside the class it cannot be accessed from outside the class. If we try to access it from outside, it will give an error.

So, in short, encapsulation allows us to make our data or code private and secure inside a class.</p>

<h3>3. Inheritance:🧬📡</h3>
<p>🔹Inheritance means that one class can inherit the properties (data) and methods (functions) of another class  in other words, it can reuse them. This helps avoid writing the same code again and again. We simply inherit the other class.

To inherit a class, we use the syntax:
"class Child extends Parent"
This allows the child class to inherit from the parent class.

If we need to access the parent class’s data inside the child class, we can use the super keyword it's a special keyword used for inheritance.

By using inheritance, we can keep our code clean, avoid complexity, and easily refer to the parent class when needed.</p>
